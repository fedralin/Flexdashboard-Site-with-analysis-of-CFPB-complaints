## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
topcompanies <- complaints %>%
  group_by(company) %>%
  summarize(totalcomplaints = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(totalcomplaints))

topcompanies
```


```{r}
responsesbreakdown <- complaints %>%
  group_by(company_response_to_consumer) %>%
  summarize(totalresponses = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(totalresponses)) %>%
  head(5)

responsesbreakdown
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
topissues <- complaints %>%
  group_by(issue) %>%
  summarize(totalissues = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(totalissues)) 

top10issues <- topissues %>%
  head(10)

top10issues
```
